# Baseline Capture: Team-Driven Development

## What to Capture
- Agent team spawn messages
- Parallelization plan output
- Phase transitions (team cleanup -> new team spawn)
- Fix cycle counts
- Completion verification

## Minimum Viable Baseline
A passing run shows:
1. Parallelization plan created
2. At least one implementation team spawned
3. At least one review team spawned
4. At least one build/test/fix team spawned
5. Clean team transitions (no overlapping teams)
6. Completion skill invoked

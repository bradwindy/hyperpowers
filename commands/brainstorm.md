Take the prompt just given to you by the user and invoke the hyperpowers brainstorming skill.

**CRITICAL:** After invoking, you MUST:
1. Read the entire skill that loads
2. Follow ALL phases in order
3. Complete ALL verification gates
4. Produce ALL required outputs

Partial compliance = failure. Simple cases still require full process.

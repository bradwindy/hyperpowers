# Hyperpowers

A complete software development workflow plugin for Claude Code. Hyperpowers guides your coding agent through brainstorming, research, planning, and execution—ensuring systematic, high-quality development instead of ad-hoc code generation.

Your agent doesn't jump into writing code. It asks what you're building, helps refine the design, researches technical approaches, creates detailed implementation plans, and executes tasks with built-in review gates.

# Research Skill

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the research skill to conduct deep technical research before planning."

## Overview

Deep research that surfaces issues before they become bugs. Dispatches 8 parallel agents to analyze codebase, git history, framework docs, best practices, test coverage, error handling, dependencies, and architecture boundaries, then synthesizes findings into a persistent research document.

<requirements>
## Requirements (MINIMUM 8 agents, synthesis)

1. Dispatch ALL 8 agents in a single message (MINIMUM - more if open questions exist). Fewer than 8 = VIOLATION. Stop immediately.
2. Synthesize findings into research document. Raw concatenation = invalid output.
3. 8 agents is the floor, not the ceiling.
</requirements>

<compliance-anchor>
You have invoked this skill. You MUST:
- Follow phases in order (no skipping)
- Complete all gates (no self-exemptions)
- Produce required outputs (no substitutions)

Failure to comply = skill failure. There is no "partial compliance."
</compliance-anchor>

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Starting work on a new feature area
- Planning requires understanding unfamiliar code
- User explicitly invokes `/hyperpowers:research`
- Writing-plans skill suggests research first

Do NOT use when:
- Making a quick fix to familiar code
- Research already exists in `docs/hyperpowers/research/`

## Requirements

This skill produces valid output only when both are met:

1. **Dispatch all 8 agents** in one message. Dispatching fewer produces incomplete research.
2. **Synthesize findings** into a coherent document. Concatenating raw output is not synthesis.

If blocked from either requirement, stop and explain why.

## The Process

### Phase 0: Check for Design Document

Before topic clarification, check if a design document exists:

**If invoked with a path argument:**
1. Check if the path points to a file in `docs/hyperpowers/designs/` or `docs/hyperpowers/plans/`
2. If file exists: Read the FULL content (it will be included verbatim in the research doc)
3. If file missing: Warn "Design doc not found at [path], falling back to clarification"

**If no path provided:**
1. Search `docs/hyperpowers/designs/` for recent design docs (within 7 days)
2. If found: Ask "Found design doc [filename]. Use this for research?" (Yes/No)
3. If not found or declined: Proceed to Phase 1 clarification

**When design doc found:**
- Store the FULL design document content (will be included verbatim in Phase 3)
- Extract "Open Questions" section for agent prompts
- Add to each agent prompt in Phase 2:
  ```
  Additionally, investigate these open questions from the design:
  - [question 1]
  - [question 2]
  ```
- Skip Phase 1 clarification (design already clarifies the topic)

### Issue Context Handling in Phase 0

**If design doc found with Original Issue block:**
- Extract the "## Original Issue" section verbatim
- Store for inclusion in research output (Phase 3)
- Do NOT re-fetch from issue tracker (use captured version)

**If no design doc AND issue ID provided as argument:**
1. Dispatch issue-tracking agent:
   ```
   Task(description: "Fetch issue body",
        prompt: "Operation: get-issue-body
   Issue: [issue ID from argument]",
        model: "haiku",
        subagent_type: "hyperpowers:issue-tracking:issue-tracking")
   ```

2. Assess and confirm classification (same as brainstorming Phase 0)

3. Store for inclusion in research output

**If neither design doc nor issue ID:** Proceed without Original Issue block.

### Phase 1: Clarify the Topic (if no design doc)

If the research topic is ambiguous, ask 2-3 targeted questions using AskUserQuestion:
- What specific aspect needs investigation?
- What decisions will the research inform?
- Are there known constraints or concerns?

If clear, proceed directly to Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Spawn Research Team

### Dispatch Verification (check BEFORE spawning)

You will spawn exactly 8 researcher teammates:
1. codebase-analyst
2. git-history-analyzer
3. framework-docs-researcher
4. best-practices-researcher
5. test-coverage-analyst
6. error-handling-analyst
7. dependency-analyst
8. architecture-boundaries-analyst

### Common Rationalizations (ALL INVALID)

These thoughts mean you're about to violate the 8-agent minimum. STOP.

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll spawn the most relevant agents" | ALL agents are relevant. Each has unique perspective. |
| "These agents overlap" | Overlap is intentional - contradictions are valuable. |
| "To save time/tokens" | 8 parallel teammates IS the efficient approach. |
| "Given the simple topic" | No topic is too simple for all 8. Simplicity is deceptive. |
| "I already know the answer" | Research validates, doesn't assume. Spawn all 8. |

**Spawn Gate** (Required - NEVER skip):

STOP. Before proceeding, verify you will spawn ALL of these as teammates:
- [ ] codebase-analyst
- [ ] git-history-analyzer
- [ ] framework-docs-researcher
- [ ] best-practices-researcher
- [ ] test-coverage-analyst
- [ ] error-handling-analyst
- [ ] dependency-analyst
- [ ] architecture-boundaries-analyst
- [ ] Additional teammates for any open questions discovered

**STOP CONDITION (MANDATORY):** Count your teammates before spawning.

- Less than 8 = VIOLATION. Do not proceed.
- Design doc has open questions? Add 1 teammate per question (Phase 2.5a).
- Minimum teammates = 8 + (number of open questions)

If count is wrong, FIX IT before proceeding. No exceptions. No rationalizations.

### Spawn the Research Team

**Create an agent team** named "Research: [topic]" with the following teammates:

For each researcher, use the agent definition content from the corresponding file in `agents/research/` as their spawn prompt. Include:
- The specific research topic
- Any open questions from the design document
- The instruction: "You are operating as a teammate. Follow the Teammate Instructions section in your agent definition."

**Teammate spawn list:**

1. **Codebase Analyst** — spawn with content from `agents/research/codebase-analyst.md` plus research topic
2. **Git History Analyzer** — spawn with content from `agents/research/git-history-analyzer.md` plus research topic
3. **Framework Docs Researcher** — spawn with content from `agents/research/framework-docs-researcher.md` plus research topic
4. **Best Practices Researcher** — spawn with content from `agents/research/best-practices-researcher.md` plus research topic
5. **Test Coverage Analyst** — spawn with content from `agents/research/test-coverage-analyst.md` plus research topic
6. **Error Handling Analyst** — spawn with content from `agents/research/error-handling-analyst.md` plus research topic
7. **Dependency Analyst** — spawn with content from `agents/research/dependency-analyst.md` plus research topic
8. **Architecture Boundaries Analyst** — spawn with content from `agents/research/architecture-boundaries-analyst.md` plus research topic

Each researcher should:
1. Conduct their specialized analysis
2. Share findings with relevant teammates via targeted `write` messages
3. Challenge findings from other researchers that touch their domain
4. Update their findings based on peer feedback
5. Use `broadcast` only for critical team-wide findings

**After spawning:** Wait for all researchers to complete their peer discussion before proceeding to synthesis.

### Phase 2.5a: Open Question Teammates (Conditional)

If design document had an "Open Questions" section, spawn additional teammates into the existing research team:

**Step 1: Analyze each open question to determine best-fit researcher type:**

| Question Type | Best-Fit Researcher |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Framework/API questions | framework-docs-researcher |
| Code architecture questions | codebase-analyst or architecture-boundaries-analyst |
| Historical "why" questions | git-history-analyzer |
| Performance/security questions | best-practices-researcher |
| Testing approach questions | test-coverage-analyst |
| Error handling questions | error-handling-analyst |
| Dependency questions | dependency-analyst |

**Step 2: Spawn one additional teammate per open question** into the existing team. Use the corresponding agent definition from `agents/research/` as the spawn prompt, but focus the prompt on the specific open question:

"Focus ONLY on this open question from the design doc: '[full question text]'. Research this specific question thoroughly. Share your findings with the full team."

**Step 3: Update spawn count verification:**

Total teammates spawned = 8 core + N open question teammates

**Skip Condition:** If design doc has no "Open Questions" section, skip Phase 2.5a entirely.

### Phase 2.6: Issue Discovery (Optional)

If an issue tracker is detected, dispatch issue-tracking agent for discovery:

```
Task(description: "Discover related issues",
     prompt: "Operation: discover
Context: [user's research topic]
Branch: [current branch name if relevant]

Find issues related to this research topic.",
     model: "haiku",
     subagent_type: "general-purpose")
```

If no tracker detected, skip this phase (will note in output).

### Phase 2.9: Team Cleanup

Before synthesizing, shut down the research team:
1. Request shutdown for all researcher teammates
2. Wait for all teammates to approve shutdown
3. Call cleanup to remove team resources
4. Retry cleanup up to 3 times if it fails
5. If cleanup fails after 3 retries, escalate to user via AskUserQuestion

**STOP CONDITION:** Do not proceed to synthesis until team is cleaned up (one team per session constraint).

### Phase 3: Synthesize Findings

After all agents complete, synthesize their findings into a research document.

**Team-Based Synthesis Enhancement:**

The lead synthesizes findings that have already been peer-reviewed by the research team. When writing the synthesis:
- Note where researchers agreed (peer-validated findings)
- Note where researchers disagreed and how it was resolved
- Note where researchers challenged each other's conclusions
- Include cross-domain observations from the "Peer Interactions" and "Cross-Domain Observations" sections of each researcher's output

**Research Document Format:**

```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

> Generated: [YYYY-MM-DD]
> Design Doc: docs/hyperpowers/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md (if exists)
> Issue: [if linked]

### Agent Output Consumption Gate

Before saving, verify all agents' findings are incorporated:

- [ ] All 8 core agents' findings cited
- [ ] All open question agents' findings cited (if Phase 2.5a executed)
- [ ] Total agent count matches 8 + N (where N = open questions, or 0 if none)
- [ ] Each agent's output file path stated
- [ ] Key findings from EACH agent quoted in synthesis
- [ ] Contradictions between agents noted and resolved
- [ ] No agent's findings silently dropped

**STOP CONDITION:** If synthesis doesn't cite all 8 + N agents, stop. Quote findings from missing agents.

<verification>
### Synthesis Verification (check BEFORE saving)

- [ ] Executive Summary written (your synthesis, not copy-paste)
- [ ] All 8 agent sections populated with findings
- [ ] Edge Cases synthesized from multiple agents
- [ ] Contradictions between agents noted

**STOP CONDITION:** If any section empty or placeholder, complete before saving.
</verification>

**Per-Agent Citation Checklist:**

- [ ] Codebase Analyst findings cited
- [ ] Git History Analyzer findings cited
- [ ] Framework Docs Researcher findings cited
- [ ] Best Practices Researcher findings cited
- [ ] Test Coverage Analyst findings cited
- [ ] Error Handling Analyst findings cited
- [ ] Dependency Analyst findings cited
- [ ] Architecture Boundaries Analyst findings cited

**STOP CONDITION:** If any agent missing from synthesis, go back and incorporate their findings.

The Executive Summary and Edge Cases sections should be YOUR synthesis, not raw agent output. These sections demonstrate combined findings.

### Phase 3.5: Assumption Validation

After synthesis completes, validate technical assumptions:

1. **Dispatch assumption checker agent**
   ```
   Task(description: "Validate research assumptions",
        prompt: "[Include full research document content here]

   Validate all technical assumptions in this research document.
   Return structured output with Validated/Invalid/Unverified sections.",
        model: "haiku",
        subagent_type: "hyperpowers:research:assumption-checker")
   ```

2. **Parse agent output**
   - Extract the Validated Assumptions section
   - Count invalid assumptions (❌ items)

3. **Embed results in research document**
   - Add "## Validated Assumptions" section before "## Open Questions"
   - Include all three subsections (✅/❌/⚠️)

4. **If invalid assumptions found**
   ```
   AskUserQuestion(
     questions: [{
       question: "Found N invalid assumptions in research. How would you like to proceed?",
       header: "Assumptions",
       options: [
         {label: "Review and address", description: "Pause to fix invalid assumptions before saving"},
         {label: "Continue anyway", description: "Save research with invalid assumptions noted"},
         {label: "Show details", description: "Display full validation report"}
       ],
       multiSelect: false
     }]
   )
   ```

5. **Proceed to Phase 4 (Save) after user response**

**Error Handling:**
- If agent times out: Note "Assumption validation incomplete" in document, proceed to save
- If no assumptions found: Note "No technical assumptions to validate" in document

### Phase 4: Save Research Document

Save to: `docs/hyperpowers/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md`

Example: `docs/hyperpowers/research/2026-01-15-user-authentication.md`

**Output Gate** (Required - NEVER skip):

STOP. Before announcing completion, verify:
- [ ] File EXISTS at `docs/hyperpowers/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md`
- [ ] Quote the first line of the file you just wrote (proof you wrote it)
- [ ] **Store this exact path for Phase 5 handoff** (do NOT use the design doc path from Phase 0)

If file doesn't exist, you have NOT completed research. Write it now.

**Path Reminder:** Your OUTPUT is `docs/hyperpowers/research/...`, your INPUT was `docs/hyperpowers/designs/...`. The handoff uses OUTPUT.

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "I'll just summarize in chat" | NO. Document MUST be written to file. Chat is ephemeral. |
| "The user can see my synthesis" | NO. Next skill needs the file path. No file = broken handoff. |

### Phase 5: Announce Completion

**Completion Enforcement** (CRITICAL):

Your FINAL message MUST contain the handoff block. This is NOT optional.

STOP. Look at your planned final message. Does it contain:
```
Research complete and saved to `docs/hyperpowers/research/<actual-filename>.md`.

To continue:
/compact ready to plan docs/hyperpowers/research/<actual-filename>.md
/hyperpowers:writing-plans docs/hyperpowers/research/<actual-filename>.md
```

If NO: Add it. You cannot announce completion without this exact block.
If YES: Proceed with sending.

<verification>
### Handoff Path Verification Gate

**STOP CONDITION:** Before writing your handoff message, verify the path:

- [ ] Handoff path starts with `docs/hyperpowers/research/` (NOT `designs/`)
- [ ] Handoff path matches the file you saved in Phase 4
- [ ] Handoff path is the RESEARCH doc you created, not the DESIGN doc you consumed

**Common Confusion (INVALID - will break workflow):**

| Wrong Path | Why It's Wrong | Correct Path |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| `docs/hyperpowers/designs/...` | This is your INPUT (design doc) | `docs/hyperpowers/research/...` |
| Path from Phase 0 | Phase 0 reads design; Phase 4 writes research | Path from Phase 4 |

**Self-Check:** The path in your handoff MUST match the path in Phase 4 where you wrote: "Save to: `docs/hyperpowers/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md`"

If paths don't match, STOP and fix before sending.
</verification>

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "User knows what's next" | NO. Explicit commands prevent context loss. |
| "I'll mention it casually" | NO. Copy-paste commands, not prose descriptions. |
| "Compacting isn't always needed" | WRONG. Context degrades. ALWAYS suggest compact. |

Replace `<actual-filename>` with the real filename you just created.

**Design doc note:** If a design doc was used, add: "The full design document has been preserved in the research doc."

<completion-check>
Before announcing completion, verify you followed the skill:
- [ ] Completed all phases in order (0 → 1 → 2 → 2.5 → 3 → 3.5 → 4 → 5)
- [ ] Passed all verification gates (Dispatch Gate, Synthesis Verification, Output Gate)
- [ ] Produced required outputs (research document at docs/hyperpowers/research/)

If ANY unchecked, go back and complete missing steps.
</completion-check>

<requirements>
## Requirements (reminder)

1. Dispatch ALL 8 agents in a single message (MINIMUM - more if open questions exist). Fewer than 8 = VIOLATION. Stop immediately.
2. Synthesize findings into research document. Raw concatenation = invalid output.
3. 8 agents is the floor, not the ceiling.
</requirements>

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 0 | Check design doc | Full design content or proceed |
| 1 | Clarify topic (if no design) | Clear research question |
| 2 | Spawn 8 research teammates | Parallel team research |
| 2.5a | Open question agents | Additional targeted research |
| 2.6 | Discover issues | Related issues list |
| 2.9 | Team cleanup | Clean up research team |
| 3 | Synthesize | Combined findings |
| 3.5 | Validate assumptions | Validated Assumptions section |
| 4 | Save | `docs/hyperpowers/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` |
| 5 | Announce | Ready for planning |

## Red Flags - Stop and Recover

| Violation | Why It's Critical | Recovery |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| Dispatching < 8 agents | Violates minimum agent requirement | Stop, add missing agents before proceeding |
| Ignoring design doc open questions | Open questions need dedicated agents | Count questions, dispatch 1 agent each |
| "Efficiency" rationalization | 8 parallel agents IS efficient | All 8 required, no exceptions |
| Writing doc before agents complete | Missing findings corrupt synthesis | Wait for all agent results |
| Concatenating without synthesizing | Raw output is not research | Write Executive Summary + Edge Cases |
| Skipping dispatch or synthesis checklist | Gates exist to prevent failures | Complete checklist before proceeding |
| "Agent X had no relevant findings" | Every agent finds something | Re-read agent output, cite at least one finding |
| Synthesis shorter than combined outputs | Lost information | Expand synthesis to cover all findings |
| Handoff suggests design doc path | Design doc is INPUT, research doc is OUTPUT | Use research doc path from Phase 4 |

## Integration

After research, run `/hyperpowers:write-plan` to create implementation plan.
